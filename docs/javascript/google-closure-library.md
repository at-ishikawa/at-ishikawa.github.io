# Google closure library
Written: October 2019.

Some JavaScript library depends on Google Closure. If you need to understand the behavior of such a library, you have to know closure.
The official document of closure library is (here)[https://developers.google.com/closure/library].
And using (Closure compiler)[https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler], we can bundle codes with those libraries. There is (npm version)[https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-npm] to use such a compiler.

The compiler can be downloaded by npm.
