title: GitHub Pages
---

Getting Started
===
See [Official tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) for detail steps.

Basically, what you have to do is
1. Create <username>.github.io repository
1. Choose theme on settings tab in GitHub


Customize pages
===
Before updating your repository, please see each repository [here](https://github.com/pages-themes) for your theme to check how to customize for your purpose.

The examples of customization are
1. Twitter share button: go to [publish twitter button page](https://publish.twitter.com/?buttonText=Share&buttonType=TweetButton&widget=Button).


Choose good theme
===
There are some pages to collect the themes of GitHub pages.
These are the pages I checked.
- [https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-themes](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-themes)
- [#jekyll-theme on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme)
- [My favorite jekyll themes on GitHub community forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/My-favorite-jekyll-themes-How-bout-you/td-p/24680)

For me, these are the themes I thought they look good.
- https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io
    - No instruction on setup
- https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs
    - Navigations can be configured on front matter in each page.
    - Search data can be generated by `just-the-docs`
- https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes
    - Highly customizable
    - Navigations including sidebar have to be configured properly by yaml files.
	- Searching entire pages is enabled by default

The important things for me was sidebar and search features, and I did not have to update every pages for sidebar, so I chose minimal-mistakes theme.
