Configurations
===

Template directory
---

See [this article](https://coderwall.com/p/jp7d5q/create-a-global-git-commit-hook) and [this](https://git-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details.
Git template is the directory to gets copied everytime when a repository is created or cloned.

1. Set a template directory: `git config --global init.templatedir '~/.config/git/templates'`
1. Create a directory for hooks: `mkdir -p ~/.config/git/templates/hooks`
1. Now we can add the hook under `~/.config/git/templates/hooks` directory, like `post-commit` file which is executable.

Pre-commit
===

I think pre-commit hook is most useful hook of all git hooks.
For example, in order to check the code is good to commit by running lint tools.
Due to this, there are some useful tools to configure hooks easily.
- [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/): Framework to manage multi-language precommit hooks.
- [husky & lint staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): npm package
