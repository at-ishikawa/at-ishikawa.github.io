# Do something while taking a shower and/or a bath

Although I tried to do a few things while taking a shower or bath in 2021, most of them didn’r work very well. So I ended up not doing them, and just read books in an ebook reader while taking a shower or a bath.

First of all, in order to use electric devices in a bathroom, we should choose those that are waterproof.
There are IPX standards for how waterproof the item is, like IP7.
See [this article](http://blog.vava.com/ipx-waterproofing-and-speakers/) for each IPX standard is. IPX8 was the best at that time and IPX7 is also acceptable.


### Listen to something

[Mpow 432 ANC Wireless Earbuds-Black – MPOW](https://www.xmpow.com/products/mpow-432-true-wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation)

* Result
    * Even with this, I couldn’t hear anything while I was taking a shower
* Why I bought this
    * Noise cancelling
    * IPX8 waterproof

* Result
    * Even with this, I couldn’t hear anything while I was taking a shower neither
* Why I bought this
    * I heard bone conduction headphone is good even if I’m in a water, like while swimming
    * IPX7 waterproof


### Write something in a bath

At first, I bought [Bath Dreams Bamboo Bathtub Caddy Tray with Extending Sides](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WCBC1BG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* It’s better to buy more flat and length tray, but this also isn’t too bad

Then I bought waterproof notebooks or note pad.

[Aqua Notes Water Proof Note Pad : Office Products](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AS5I0ZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* Result
    * This notepad is great in terms of waterproofing.
    * The size is a little bit too small. This is good if we wanna take a note for ideas not to forget while I am taking a shower, but not more than that.

[Rite in the Rain Weatherproof Side-Spiral Notebook, 8 1/2" x 11", Green Cover, Universal Page Pattern (No. 973-MX)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZUZ15JA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* Result
    * The size itself is good
    * It looks good in terms of waterproofing
    * I haven’t used it so much yet.


#### Use a tablet with a keyboard in a bath

I put the tablet in ziploc, connected a keyboard to it, and tried to use it for similar things we can do in a computer.

But the biggest problem was, my tablet was slow to do something and it wasn’t comfortable for me.

* Result
    * This couldn’t be used for my purpose because the power is required
* Why
    * It said it can be connected bluetooth
    * IPX6 waterproof

[Arteck HB030B Universal Slim Portable Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 7-Colors Backlit Keyboard with Built in Rechargeable Battery, Black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X5P8BJO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

* Result
    * This has to be put in a ziploc
    * It was hard to use this keyboard due to its size
* Why
    * It has a battery
    * It can be connected by a bluetooth
